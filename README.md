# my_nextgram

This is not my original work. This is a replica of Vercel's [NextGram](https://nextgram.vercel.app/) app. GitHub repository for Vercel's NextGram located [here](https://github.com/vercel-labs/nextgram). 

The purpose of here is to get experience building a Next.js app that uses dynamic routing with modals as a route.

Following along and rebuilding this from scratch will help me better understand how I can use [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) and [Intercepting Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes) for future projects.
